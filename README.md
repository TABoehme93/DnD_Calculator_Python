# DnD_Calculator_Python
This is the main project I am using to help imporve my Python skills.  If possible I plan on adding some for of SQL and Javascript to the process.

I have recently added a level option that will eventually be used to calculate the modifier + half level.  

The next steps are to have the modifiers half level calculations and adding racial options.
To add the racial options for the time being I may use Excel in place of a database to store the data.  As well as having it work as blueprint for the database.
